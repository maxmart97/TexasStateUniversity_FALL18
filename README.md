# TexasStateUniversity_FALL18

This repository contains projects from my programming class during the Fall 2018 semester.

The projects should all run in Visual Studio.

My code is typically within the Form.cs and Class.cs files.

TO SEE THE MAIN PROJECT THAT I WORKED ON THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE SEMESTER, GO TO THE SPORTSPRO REPOSITORY.
